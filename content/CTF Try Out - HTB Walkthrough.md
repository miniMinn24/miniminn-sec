## Introduction

I woke up with a realization that when I'll be ready to learn CTF? — Not until I start once for sure.

As a complete newcomer, I joined HackTheBox's **CTF Try Out** event for my first experience to play CTF. Honestly, I struggled solving these challenges because I have no experience in using tools. The thing I realized is that HTB wants you to never stop exploring and breaking things.

I wrote this full walk-through to help anyone who can't find a clue, not to cheat, but to learn and enjoy the process!

> [!NOTE]
> Since I'm just also a newcomer, please be aware that some writeup details might be **missing** or **un-perfectly explained**, but I gave my full efforts on this. Enjoy!

## About Team

- **Team Name**: mɨnɨM1nn
- **Motto**: "Listen to the silence."
- **Members**: mɨnɨMinn

## Preparation

So, to know CTF standards for sure, HTB uses **custom services** on non-standard ports.

- If the port number is `22`, it's likely SSH:

```bash
# Example
ssh 126.211.34.10 -p 22
```

- Any other port (e.g., `3000`, `9000`, `3657`) - it likely a website or a raw TCP service meant for `netcat`:

```bash
# Example
nc 20.382.480.21 3000
```

# Hardware Challenges

## It's Oops PM

**Difficulty**: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Very easy</mark>
**Points**: `875`
**Objective**: Trigger a backdoor in a TPM crypto-processor by providing a **specific 16-bit input**.

First, we should download the challenge files. These are **VHDL** (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) designed for a cryptographic processor used in environmental sensors communicating with a satellite.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260127145740.png]]

First connect to the challenge and let's test it out how it encrypts my input binary data of length 16 bits:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122172832.png]]

If you look at the scenario file `key.vhdl`, it encrypts using **XOR logic** by the hardcoded key in `0110001111100001`:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122173517.png]]

> But, only the specific 16-bit binary input bypasses the encryption and will trigger the hidden backdoor.

The **hardcoded backdoor pattern** is simply found in `backdoor.vhdl`, which means If `B = '1',` the output becomes the Key instead of the encrypted data:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122175012.png]]

In the service, enter the pattern we found to see if it triggers the backdoor:

## Critical Flight

**Difficulty**: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Very easy</mark>
**Points**: `900`
**Objective**: Analyze a compromised PCB design to **uncover** a hidden flag.

We got a ZIP file containing **Gerber (GBR)** files, which are used to describe the physical layers of a **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)** used in drones flight.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122191417.png]]
In summary, these include:

- **Copper**: Conductive traces connecting components.
- **Soldermask**: Protective layer (typically green) preventing shorts.
- **Silkscreen**: Text printed on the board.
- **Solderpaste**: Facilitates electrical connections.
- **Drill & Outline**: Define holes and board shape.

Since someone has sabotaged the design to make drones fail from flying, let's analyze those flight controller files with a **Gerber File Viewer** software:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260125115644.png]]

Just on the first layer called **mechanical layer**, the **first half of the flag** is found: `HTB{533_7h3_1nn32_w02k1n95`

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122192513.png]]

Meaning _`See the inner working`_, so we should keep analyzing the inner layers beneath it. In the left sidebar, I disabled layers by layers until I see the trace:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122192905.png]]

There we go, we see the second half of the flag.

> [!caution]- (SPOILER) Click to see the flag
> **The Flag:** `HTB{533_7h3_1nn32_w02k1n95_0f_313c720n1c5#$@}`

## Debug

**Difficulty**: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Easy</mark>
**Points**: `950`
**Objective**: Trigger a backdoor in a TPM crypto-processor by providing a **specific 16-bit input**.

For this challenge, we'll be doing **serial signal analysis** on **SALEAE** (.sal) file that contains recorded digital signals from a satellite dish's debugging interface:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122194854.png]]

To open those recorded signals, I'll be using **Saleae Logic 2** software, and view them in a single channel:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122201704.png]]

> _"Can you help to decode the signal and find the source of the interference?"_

As the challenge asked, we will need to decode this serial communication data with an **Async Serial analyzer**. I set the common settings as follow:

- **Baud rate**: 115200 (a common rate for satellite and embedded devices).
- **Leave the rest as default**: 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity.
  ![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122202249.png| 300]]

After applying analyzer, the output will reveal a **boot log sequence**. In the terminal output, scroll through and follow the traces:

| ![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122213235.png\| 300]] | ![[attachments/Pasted image 20260122214032.png]] |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

I copied all the terminal output and pasted in a text editor. Then, we see the flag.

# ICS (Industrial Control System) Challenges

## Shush Protocol

**Difficulty**: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Very easy</mark>
**Points**: `900`
**Objective**: Locate the packet that contains the **secret information**.

According to the challenge:

> [!quote] Scenario
> Having **captured the traffic** from that connection the only thing that remains is to locate the packet that contains the secret information.

We are provided with a network traffic captured file:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260125121808.png]]

`.pcapng` or **(PCAP Next Generation)** is a network traffic data containing raw network packets, usually headers and payloads, captured from a live network or simulated environment.

So, we shall happily use **Wireshark** software to open these files:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260125123157.png]]

Since the specific secret information is could be in one of these frames, let's first quickly filter a pattern by _"frame contains HTB{"_:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260125125214.png]]

There it is! We found the flag in that specific frame.

# Reversing Challenges

## FlagCasino

**Difficulty:** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Very easy</mark>
**Points**: `925`
**Objective**: Understand the logic of **seeded** random number generation.

We download the challenge files first, and got a pre-complied file that is executable on **x86-64 Linux systems**. Before deep dive into reversing, as I heard of, we should always try basic reconnaissance on the file.

So, I tried if there're anything useful info to see with `strings` and `file` commands, but nothing showed up.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260129123933.png]]

Let's see the decompiled code of `casino` in **Ghidra** to see how it really works:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260127162658.png]]

There're lots of codes to see, but let's break it down in summary.

So, this line reads a Char (our input) and stores in `local_d`:

```C
iVar1 = __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_001020fc,&local_d);
```

Which then, it **seeds** the random number generator using our input and generates a random number:

```C
srand((int)local_d);
iVar1 = rand();
```

What I mean by that is if you give the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">same seed</mark> to `srand()`, `rand()` will always generate the **same number.**

- `srand(seed)` seeds the **starting point** for randomness.
- `rand()` by starting point, it gives us a **number**. _(same seed = same random number)_

Now, we know it uses a kind of vulnerable random number generator which uses our input as a seed, so that we can actually predict what the random number would be.

After analyzing more to understand what the program wants us to enter, this code says something:

```C
if (iVar1 != *(int *)(check + (long)(int)local_c * 4)) {
    puts("[ * INCORRECT * ]");
    puts("[ *** ACTIVATING SECURITY SYSTEM - PLEASE VACATE *** ]");
    exit(-2);
}
puts("[ * CORRECT *]");
local_c = local_c + 1;
```

The program expects random numbers contained in that `check` array. It bases on the our input used as a **seed** to `srand()` for `rand()`, it generates a number, which then compared with `check` array expecting to be equal.

What we can do now is we can find where random numbers are **located** in the `check` array. For each located random numbers, we will determine which input character -> used as seed -> then produces that random number value (which the program expects) by `rand()`.

In Ghidra > Decompile window, I double-clicked on `check` function to see its array address:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260127214434.png]]

So, I opened `./casino` the binary file with **GDB** tool and looked up the address where the `check` array is located. Starting from the memory address `0x4080`, I viewed 30 memory units to see if these random values relevant to `check`:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260127215304.png]]

In total, **29** **integers** were only confirmed to be relevant, the last `0` wasn't a part of it.

Because of this code, which only loops from `local_c = 0` to **hex**: `0x1c` (**decimal**: `28`) times, there're 29 integers in total:

```C
while( true ) {
  if (0x1c < local_c) {
    puts("[ ** HOUSE BALANCE $0 - PLEASE COME BACK LATER ** ]");
    return 0;
  }
...
```

Now, **29 integers** are surely remain to figure out which ASCII character (`0-255`) is used as seed to `srand()`. If the seed is correct, `rand()` will generate same value as one of those 29 integers.

To do so, I used a help of Python script to automate this process:

```python
import ctypes

libc = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6")

check = [608905406,183990277,286129175, ...]
correct_inputs = "" # what ASCII inputs make correct Seeds
correct_seeds = "" # what correct Seeds generate same value as array

for target in check:
    for seed in range(256):
        libc.srand(seed)
        if libc.rand() == target:
            correct_inputs += chr(seed)
            correct_seeds += str(seed) + ","
            break

print("Inputs: ", correct_inputs)
print("Seeds: ", correct_seeds)
```

This script basically brute-forces every possible ASCII characters to see which seed gives the correct result. When a match is found in each loop, **correct inputs** are stored and also **correct seeds**.

## LootStash

**Difficulty:** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Very easy</mark>
**Points**: `925`
**Objective**: Find the flag through the **stack of items**.

> [!QUOTE] Scenario
> Can you filter through the stack to get to the _one thing you really need_?

We download the challenge files first, and as we should always do, we try basic reconnaissance on the target file:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260129130401.png]]

What a coincidence, I didn't expect that the flag would be clearly visible. So before testing the program, I extracted that binary file to see if there're some human-readable strings using with `strings` command, which then the flag was actually found _in the stack of items_.

If you're on Windows, this should work the same as well:

```PowerShell
# Available in sysinternals
strings.exe rev_lootstash/stash | Select-String "HTB{"
```

## Don't Panic!

**Difficulty:** <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Easy</mark>
**Points**: `975`
**Objective**: Extract the flag by analyzing a series of **a specific function calls**.

> [!quote] Scenario
> Now, you must find a way past the highly sensitive heat-signature detection robot.
> Can you disable the security robot without setting off the alarm?

We download the challenge files and try basic reconnaissance as should we should always do:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260201204245.png]]

We see nothing useful there. So, I explored the code with **Ghidra** and found a interesting function `src::check_flag`, seems it validates our input to the program using a loop to check characters one by one:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260201221405.png]]

This looks interesting that we see the function is called 31 times, from `0` to `1e` (30 in decimal) and this could be the characters (the flag) we're looking for. As far I have researched, these functions are handled by Rust's `FnOnce::call_once` mechanism to check characters and to ensure they're called only once in a loop.

So, I clicked on the first `FnOnce::call_once` to check what it really does:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260201221151.png]]

In the first call function, we see that it performs `cmp` (compare) instruction to compare the expected value with the corresponding character (in this case: `0x48` or "H" in ASCII) in the user input.

Now, an idea came up to my mind is to check all of these 31 `FnOnce::call_once` one by one and collect each hex values, convert them altogether into ASCII and see if I can get the flag.

So, moving on the next functions, we will find another hex values that represent ASCII characters:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260201224647.png]]

After collecting all of these hex values with [Ghex](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Ghex), we finally get the flag.

# Web Challenges

## Jailbreak

**Difficulty:** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Very easy</mark>
**Points**: `875`
**Objective**: Construct a response message by **XML** payload.

I opened the given IP address on a browser:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260217160440.png]]

I explored around the web and went through all options: STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO. At ROM, I found an XML document.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260217160926.png]]

I tried submitting that update configuration to see what it does. When we look at the bottom, we can see that the app construct a response message by extracting a specific value `<Version>` from the XML input:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260217161715.png]]

With this chance, I wrote a XML payload to read the flag and present it in `<Version>` tag:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE xxe [
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt">
]>

<FirmwareUpdateConfig>
    <Firmware>
        <Version>&xxe;</Version>
    </Firmware>
</FirmwareUpdateConfig>
```
