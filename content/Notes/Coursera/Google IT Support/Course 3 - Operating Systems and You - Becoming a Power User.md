# Module 1 - Navigating the System

Command-line interpreter in **Linux** - **shell**
Language interact with - **Bash**

```powershell
# Manual entry for commands
Get-Help ls -Full

# Shows system and hidden files
ls -Force C:\
```

**Absolute path**: One that starts from the main directory.
**Relative path**: The path from your current directory. `cd ..`

```powershell
mkdir my` cool` folder # mkdir "my cool folder"

# Bash
mkdir my\ cool\ folder
```

Check powershell history with `Ctrl + R`

```powershell
PS C:\Users\miniMinn> Stop-Service sshd
bck-i-search: ssh_
```

**Wildcard**: A character that's used to help select files based on a certain pattern.

```powershell
rm important_text.txt -Force
rm important_text.txt -Recurse
```

`cat` - concatenate

```powershell
# Stops showing contents once the terminal screen is full | scrollable
more large_text.txt

cat lists.txt -Head 10 # first ten lines
cat lists.txt -Tail 10 # last ten lines
```

```bash
$ less large_text.txt # similar to `more` on Windows
```

Hotkeys: `g` - beginning of content, `G` end of content

```powershell
Start notepad '.\New Text.txt'
```

Alias of commands (e.g. `ls` how does actually run)

```powershell
PS C:\Users\miniMinn\Windows_Lab> Get-Alias ls
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ----
Alias           ls -> Get-ChildItem
```

Searching contents in files, or command `sls`

```powershell
Select-Strings New *.txt
```

Searching within directories

```powershell
ls ./ -Recurse -Filter *.exe # search only for .exe in current directory
```

```bash
$ grep text *.txt
```

IO, and pipline

```powershell
echo new_word > text.txt

# Pipeline
cat words.txt | sls ht
```

`>` overrides, `>>` append

`1: stdout` - the output `<`
`2: stderr` - the error `2>`

```powershell
# Redirect error message
rm secured.txt 2> errors.txt

rm secrued.txt 2> $null
```

```bash
$ ls /fake/dir 2>/dev/null
```

---

# Module 2 - Users and Permissions

**Windows Domain** - A network of computers, users, files, ... that are added to a central database.
**User Account Control (UAC)** - A feature in Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to a system.

```powershell
# Get users list info
Get-LocalUser

# Get groups info
Get-LocalGroup

# Get memebers info
Get-LocalGroupMember <Group_Name>
```

## Linux | Bash

**su** in bash means "substitute user" or "switch user" to temporarily become another user. Default is **root**.

```bash
$ sudo su - # Change full environment/path | login shell switch
$ sudo su   # Retains current environment/path

# View groups info
$ cat /etc/group

# View users info
$ cat /etc/passwd
```

Groups info viewing:

- `sudo:x:27:miniminn` - Group name, password (hashed), group ID, and list of users
  Users info viewing:
- `sudo:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash` - Username, password (hashed, stored in different file), user ID/UID (sudo default is `0`)

Change user password Bash, it's securely scrambled, then stored in a special privileged file - `/etc/shadow`

```bash
$ passwd <user_name> # Stored in /etc/shadow
```

Forcing user password to change on next logon:

```bash
# Immediately expire a user's password
# So it made them set a new password next time they login
$ sudo passwd -e <user_name>
```

Adding/Deleting user account:

```bash
# Creating
$ sudo useradd <user_name>

# Deleting
$ sudo userdel <user_name>
```

### File Permissions

```bash
drwxr-xr-x miniminn miniminn 4.0 KB Thur Sep 26 11:04:46 2025 My_Directory
```

- `d` - file type (directory, regular file, ...)
- `rwxr-x-r-x` - Permissions of Owner, Group, and Other
- `miniminn miniminn` - User, Group

### Modifying Permissions

The owner - `u`
The group the file belongs to - `g`
Other users - `o`

```bash
# Giving executable permission to the onwer
$ chmod u+x <file_path>

# Removing permission
$ chmod u-x <file_path>

# Other permissions | execute, read, write
$ chmod u+rwx <file_path>
```

The numerical equivalent of **rwx**:

- `4` for **read**
- `2` for **write**
- `1` for **execute**

```bash
# 7 for Owner, 5 for our Group, and 4 for all other user
$ chmod 754 <file_path>
```

Changing the owner of the file:

```bash
$ sudo chown <user_name> <file_path>

# Verify
$ ls -l <file_path>
```

Chaning the Group of file belongs to:

```bash
$ sudo chgrp <group_name> <file_path>

# Verify
$ ls -l <file_path>
```

### SetUID, SetGID, Sticky Bit

**SetUID** - Enable files to be run by the permissions of the **owner** of a file, that's why you can run `passwd` by **root permission** to change your password:

```bash
# We can run `passwd` as regular user, but it's owned by root
$ ls -ld /etc/shadow
-rw------- root root ... /etc/shadow

# Verify
$ ls -ld /bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x root root ... /bin/passwd
```

In `-rwsr-xr-x`, `s` stands for **SetUID**

> When `s` is substituted, it allows to run the file with the permissions of the owner of the file.

```bash
# Which runs as TTY (group) as you see here
$ ls -ld /usr/bin/wall
.rwxr-sr-x root tty ... /usr/bin/wall
```

The numerical equivalent of **special permissions**:

- `4` or `s` - **SUID** - Run with owner's privileges.
- `2` or `g` - **GUID** - Run with group's privileges.
- `1` or `t` - **Sticky Bit** - Only the file owner can delete or modify files in a directory.

Enabling **SUID** - Run with owner's privileges:

```bash
# -rwsr-xr-x
$ chmod 4755 <file_path>
```

Enabling **GUID** - Run with group's privileges:

```bash
# ... miniminn linux_lab ...
$ chmod 2755 <file_path>
```

Enabling **Sticky Bit** - Makes anyone can write, but can't delete anything:

```bash
# -rwxr-xr-t
$ chmod 1
$ ls /usr/bin/passwd -l
.rwsr-xr-x root root ... /usr/bin/passwd
```

## Windows | Powershell

> **Net** - A legacy command-line utility in Windows used for managing network resources, users, groups, and services.

Change user password on Powershell:

```powershell
net user <user_name> *
Type a password for the user: ****
```

Add user:

```powershell
net user <user_name> * /add
# Type password

# Confirm account created
Get-LocalUser

# Asking to change password in next login
net user <user_name> /logonpasswordchg:yes

# Add new user | change password in next login
net user <user_name> "password" /add /logonpasswordchg:yes
```

Deleting user:

```powershell
net user <user_name> /del # Or
Remove-LocalUser <user_name>
```

### File Permissions

File and directory permissions are assigned using **ACLs** (Access Control List). For now, **Discretionary ACL** or **DACLs**.
Windows files and folders can also have **System ACLs** or **SACLs** assigned to them.

Command-line utility - `ICACLs` or **Improved Change ACLs**

```powershell
> ICACLs ~\Desktop
C:\Users\miniMinn\Desktop\ NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
                           BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
                           DESKTOP-5TOOLJF\miniMinn:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
```

**NTFS** permissions can be inherited.
![[attachments/Pasted image 20251015145621.png| 500]]

### Modifying Permissions

Adding permissions or adding users to a file/folder through GUI: **Right click > Properties > Security > Add > ...**

Through Powershell:

```powershell
# Letting everyone see file
icacls <path_file> /grant "Everyone:(OI)(CI)(R)"

# Letting only Authenticated User to see | Authenticated Group
icacls <path_file> /grant "Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(R)"

# Removing
icacls <path_file> /remove "Everyone"

# Verify permissions
icacls <path_file>
```

### Special Permissions

`WD`: Create Files/Write Data
`AD`: Create Folders/Append Data
`S`: Synchronize

## Linux | Bash

```bash
# Installing
$ sudo dpkg -i program.deb

# Uninstalling | Remove
$ sudo dpkg -r program

# Verifying if program is installed

$ tar -xvf my_archive.tar -C "/destination/path"
```

### Package Manager | APT

- The repository source file in Ubuntu - `/etc/apt/sources.list`
  - `sudo apt update` - updates the source lists for latest software.
  - `sudo apt upgrade` - installs the latest software from latest updated source.
- Arch Linux - `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`

### Devices and Drivers

- `/dev/sda` - First SCSI drive
- `/dev/sr0` - First optical disk drive
- `/dev/usb` - USB device
- `/dev/usbhid` - USB mouse
- `/dev/usb/lp0` - USB printer
- `/dev/null` - discard

Some of the Linux device categories include:

- **Block devices**: Devices that can hold data, such as hard drives, USB drives, and filesystems.
- **Character devices**: Devices that input or output data one character at a time, such as keyboards, monitors, and printers.
- **Pipe devices**: Similar to character devices. However, pipe devices send output to a process running on the Linux machine instead of a monitor or printer.
- **Socket devices**: Similar to pipe devices. However, socket devices help multiple processes communicate with each other.

```bash
# Verifying currnet version of OS
$ uname -r

# Full OS update | Debian
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

## Windows | PowerShell

- **Executable file (.exe)** - Contain instructions for a computer to execute when they're run.
- **Microsoft Install Packge (.msi)** - Guides a program called the **Windows Installer** in the installation, maintenance, and removal of programs on the Windows OS.

```powershell
\path\to\setup.exe
```

- `/log:[path to log file]`: Enables verbose logging (more detailed information recorded in the log file) for the update installation.
- `/lang:lcid`: Sets the user interface to the specified locale when multiple locales are available in the package.
- `/quiet`: Runs the package in silent mode.
- `/passive`: Runs the update without any interaction from the user.
- `/norestart`: Prevents prompting of the user when a restart of the computer is needed.
- `/forcerestart`: Forces a restart of the computer as soon as the update is finished.

**Package Archives** - The core or source software files that are compressed into one file. `WinRAR, .tar, 7zip`

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path <file_path> <output_path>
```

#### Dynamic Link Library (DLL)

Contains reusable code - to help conserve disk space and use RAM efficiently. App only uses when it needs - eliminating the need to update the entire library. DLL updates are installed once for use by any number of apps.

Common DLLs used by Windows:

- **.drv files** - Devices drivers manage the operation of physical devices (_e.g. printers_)
- **.ocx files** - Active X controls provide controls (_like the program object for selecting a date from a calendar_).
- **.cpl files** - Control panel files manage each of the functions found in the Windows Control Panel

### Package Manager

```powershell
# Finding package
Find-Package sysinternals -IncludeDependencies

# Installing package
Install-Package -Name sysinternals

# Verifying if it is installed
Get-Package -name sysinternals

# Uninstalling package
Uninstall-Package -name sysinternals
```

# Module 4 - Filesystems

Two main partition table schemes:

- **Master Boot Record (MBR)** - Mostly in Windows, Old Standard
  - 2 TB max volume size
  - (only 4) Primary partitions
- **GUID Partition Table (GPT)** - New standard, required by UEFI
  - 2 TB or greater volume size
  - One type of partition
  - Unlimited partitions

## Linux | Bash

`parted` - supports GPT and MBR:

```bash
# List connected disks
$ sudo parted -l

# Manage specific disk
$ sudo parted /dev/sdb  # e.g. USB flash drive

# See disk again
$ (parted) print

# Making the label GPT
$ (parted) mklabel gpt

# Partition
$ (parted) mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 5GiB

# Format partition
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

### Mounting and Unmounting a Filesystem in Linux

File System Table **fstab**: A Linux configuration table to simplify **mounting** and **unmounting** file systems in Linux.

| Filesystem                               | Mount Point                        | Type                                                         | Options                                                   | Dump                              | Pass                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/dev/sda1`                              | `/`                                | `ext3`                                                       | `nouser`                                                  | `0`                               | `1`                                           |
| `/dev/sda2`                              | `swap`                             | `swap`                                                       | `defaults`                                                | `0`                               | `0`                                           |
| `/dev/hda1`                              | `/mnt/shared`                      | `ntfs`                                                       | `rw, noexec`                                              | `0`                               | `2`                                           |
| The Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) | Directory location of mount point. | The filesystem types _e.g. ext2, ext3, ext4, JFS, VFAT, ..._ | Restriction options _e.g. nouser, noexec, auto, ro, sync_ | Turn on backup operations or off. | Order which should be check by `fsck` utility |

```bash
$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 476.9G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot
└─sda2   8:2    0 476.4G  0 part /
zram0  253:0    0   3.8G  0 disk [SWAP]
```

- **MAJ:MIN** - 1 = RAM, 3 = IDE hard drive, 8 = SCSI hard drive, 9 = RAID metadisk. **MIN** is ID number used by the device driver for the major number type (sub-partitions).
- **RM** - `0` not removable or `removable`
- **SIZE** - storage avaiable
- **RO** - `0` read-write, `1` read-only
- **Type** - `disk` hard drive, `part` disk partition
- **MOUNTPOINT** - location where the device is mounted. Blank entry means not mounted.

### Swap

```bash
$ sudo parted /dev/sdb
$ (parted) mkpart primary linux-swap 5GiB 100%
$ (parted) print

# Activiation
$ sudo mkswap /dev/sdb2 # Enter path here
$ sudo swapon /dev/sdb2
```

### Files

![[attachments/Pasted image 20251023122128.png| 400]]

```bash
# Third files indicates the amount of hard links the file has - 0 means the file is completely removed from the computer
$ ls -l file
-rw-rw-r-- 1 miniminn cindy 0 Oct 5 16:40 file

# Creating softlink
$ ln -s file file_softlink

# Creating hardlink
$ ln file file_hardlink
```

```bash
# Shows how much free space left
$ df
```

### Filesystem Repair

`fsck` (Filesystem Check) - Auto repairing the disk

```bash
$ sudo fsck /dev/sdb
```

Enabling **fsck** on boot:

```bash
# Debian and Ubuntu
- Edit the rcS file: $ sudo vi /etc/default/rcS
- FSCKFIX=yes

# CentOS
- Create or edit a file: $ sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/autofsck
- Add following line: AUTOFSCK_DEF_CHECK=yes
```

## Windows | PowerShell

- **Cluster** (allocation unit size): The minimum amount of space a file can take up in a volume or drive.
- **Volume**: A single accessible storage area with a single file system; this can be across a single disk or multiple.
- **Partition**: A logical division of a hard disk that can create unique spaces on a single drive. Generally used for allowing multiple operating systems.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20251020170928.png| 400]]
**\*Example**: If the cluster size is 4kb and the file you're trying to store is 4.1kb, that file will take up 2 clusters - losing 3.9 kb of space for use on a single file.\*

```powershell
Diskpart # opens up new window

# List current disks
DISKPART> list disk

# Identify and select specific disk
DISKPART> select disk <disk_number>

# Wiping disk
DISKPART> clean

# Creates blank partition
DISKPART> create partition primary

# Select freshly created partition | which is 1
DISKPART> select partition 1

# Making it active
DISKPART> active

# Format in NTFS filesystem
DISKPART> format FS=NTFS label=My-USB quick
```

### Swap

**Virtual Memory** - works with paging mechinasm on hard drive.
See paging details: _Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > System properties > Advaced tab > Performance - Settings > Advaced tab_.

### Files

A component of **NTFS** is the Master File Table (**MFT**) - serves as the **central data structure** for storing metadata about all files and directories on the volume.

| ![[attachments/Pasted image 20251023115805.png\| 400]] | ![[attachments/Pasted image 20251023120137.png\| 400]] |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |

Meaning the OSs treats symbolic link just like the original files:

```powershell
# Created ~\Desktop\Links\file_1.txt and file_1_shortcut.lnk

notepad.exe file_1_shortcut.lnk # content outputs aren't readable

# Creating symbolic link
mklink file_1_symlink file_1.txt # readable
```

**Hardlinks** points out the file record number and not the file name, so the original file name can be changed and the link will still works:

```
# Creating hardlink
mklink /H file_1_hardlink file_1.txt
```

### Filesystem Repair

**Data Buffer** - A region of RAM that's used to temporarily store data while it's being moved around. _(e.g. Essentail to eject the USB drives before unplugging)_. Else, causes **Data corruption**.

> **Journaling** - Logging these changes NTFS creates a history of actions it's taken. The **recovery initiation** will use this logs.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20251023125458.png| 200]]

```powershell
# Checking disk to fix any problems with flag /F
chkdsk /F <drive> # Run as administrator

# Module 5 - Process Management

## Linux | Bash

```bash
# Listing current processes
$ tasklist
```

### Reading Process Information

```bash
# Getting snapshot of current processes
$ ps -x
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    650 ?        Ss     0:07 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --user
    652 ?        S      0:00 (sd-pam)
    660 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/bin/dbus-broker-launch --scope user
```

- **PID** - Process ID.
- **TTY** - Terminal associated with the process.
- **STAT** - R: running, T: stopped, S: interruptible sleep.
- **TIME** - Total CPU time the process has taken up.

```bash
# Getting snapshot of current process -all processes -full details
$ ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 11:17 ?        00:01:06 /sbin/init
root           2       0  0 11:17 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
```

- **UID** - User ID who runs the command.
- **PPID** - Parent ID which launches the process.
- **C** - Children process of parent.

Another way view current processes running:

```bash
# Remember that everything is a file on Linux
$ ls -l /proc

# More detail
$ cat /proc/<PID>/status
Name:	gdbus
Umask:	0022
State:	S (sleeping)
Tgid:	1080
Ngid:	0
Pid:	1101
...
```

### Managing Processes

```bash
# Hey there process, I don't need you complete so could you stop what you're doing? | cleanup | SIGTERM signal
kill <PID>

# Hey, it's time to die mr. process! | no cleanup | SIGKILL signal
kill -KILL <PID>

# suspending | SIGSTP signal
kill -TSTP <PID>

# resuming | SIGCONT signal
kill -CONT <PID>
```

### Resource Monitoring

```bash
# See top CPU used processes
$ top

# Seeing OS's uptime | load average
$ uptime
16:02:24 up 1 day,  4:44,  1 user,  load average: 1.34, 1.36, 1.19

# See current processes -all -userlist -root's
$ ps -aux
```

## Windows | Powershell

```powershell
# Getting PID of specific process
Get-Process

# Getting top 3 most CPU used processes
Get-Process | Sort CPU -descending | Select -first 3 -Property ID,ProcessName,CPU

# Module 6 - Operating Systems in Practice

## Linux | Bash

### File Transfer

**Secure Copy Protocol (SCP)**: A utility for securely transferring files between a local host and a remote host, or between two remote hosts, uses SSH protocol for encryption and authentication.

```bash
$ scp /path/file hostname@ipaddress:/path/directory
```

### Linux Logs

All logs are stored at `/var/log`:

- `/var/log/auth.log` - Authentication related logs.
- `/var/log/kern.log` - Kernel message logs.
- `/var/log/dmesg` - System startup message logs. (e.g. To check boot errors)
- `/var/log/syslog` - Stores events, but no off events, to contain comprehensive info.
  > The commonly seen timestamp formats uses **Unix Epoch time**.

**Logrotate** - A utility to automate the management of log files on Linux systems, simplifying the process of **rotating, compressing, removing, and mailing** log files, typically run daily via a cron job or systemd timer.

- `/etc/logrotate.conf` for global settings and `/etc/logrotate.d/` for application-specific configurations.

### Working with Logs

Find specific word or what word could relate to the problem:

```bash
$ lesss /var/log/syslog | grep error
```

> Another way, checking the logs in **real time**.

```bash
$ tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

In Arch Linux, the default logging system is systemd-journald, which stores logs in the `/var/log/journal/`.

### OSs Deployment Methods

`dd` - A powerful utility for low-level data copying and conversion, primarily used for tasks like <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disk cloning, creating disk images, backing up partitions, and writing ISO files to USB drives</mark>.

Searching for large files:

```bash
# Search size of all, sort, top 5
$ sudo du -a ./path | sort -n -r | head -n 5
```

## Windows | Powershell

**Mirosoft Terminal Services** `mstsc.exe` - used to connect and create RDP connections to remote computers.

> Enable **Remote Desktop** in _Settings > Remote desktop_ and connect it with using `mstsc.exe`.

Common SSH Clients:

- **PuTTY**: Windows, protocols: SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connection.
- **SecureCRT**: Cross-platform, protocols: SSH1, SSH2, Telnet, and Telnet/SSL.
- **SmarTTY**: With a multi-tabbed interface to allow multiple simultaneous connections, protocols: SSH and SCP
- **mRemoteNG**: Remote desktop system with a tabbed interface for multiple simultaneous connetions, protocols: RDP, VNC, SSH, Telnet, HTTP/HTTPS, rlogin, Raw Socket Connections, Powershell remoting.
- **MobaXterm**: Remote access system, Unix and Linux, Windows, protocols: SSH, X11, RDP, VNC.

The PuTTY package comes with a tool called the **PuTTY Secure Copy Client**, or **pscp.exe**.

```powershell
pscp.exe C:\Users\user_name\Desktop\file.txt username@104.131.122.215:
```

Giving full permissions everyone on the network to a folder `ShareMe` (requires Administrative privillages):

```powershell
net share ShareMe=C:\Users\user_name\Desktop\ShareMe /grant:everyone,full
```

### The Windows Event Viewer

Execute the software with `eventvmr.msc`.

### OS Deployment Methods

- **NinjaOne Backup** - Cloud-based cloning, backup, and data recovery service, for managed service providers (MSPs) and remote workplaces.
- **Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office** - Desktop and mobile device cloning, works with Windows, Apple, and Android.
- **Barracuda Intronis Backup** - Cloud-based cloning and backup service, can integrate with professional services automation (PSA) and remote monitoring and management (RMM) packages.
- **ManageEngine OS Deployer** - Software for replications, migrations, standardizing system configs, security, and more. Creates images of Windows, MacOS, and Linux OSs with all drivers, system configs, and user profiles.
- **EaseUS Todo Backup** - Free Windows-compatible software for differential, incremental, and full backups, as well as disaster recovery, supports copying from NAS, RAID, and USB drives.

### Windows Troubleshooting

- Is the problem unique to one computer or all computers on the network?
- Does the problem affect a single user or all users?
- Is the problem related to a particular application? Is that application up-to-date?
