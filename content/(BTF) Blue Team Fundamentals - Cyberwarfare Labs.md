# Deploying VirtualBox

> CWL offers hands-on, locally deployable cybersecurity operations through realistic **lab environments**.

They're usually deployable with VMware. Since I don't have installed VMware due to difficult installation process, I used **VirtualBox** instead.

Lab files came in ZIP file, which I extracted it looks like:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223210922.png]]

## Step 1 - Creating a VM

To setup these lab files originally created by VMware on **VirtualBox**, we must create a same VM with same settings. So, look at `.vmx` file to see its basic settings:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223211408.png]]

I created one VM:`BTF_CWL_Lab` with that same settings:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223212042.png]]

Since I don't have high-end laptop, I lowered the Base Memory to **2GBs** and set only **2 Processors** (But it should work Ahaha).  
One more important thing is to:

- **Disable EFI** option.
- Change Network settings to **Bridged Adapter** (otherwise, Ping might fail)

After these, I imported `.vmdk` file to the VM:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223211843.png]]

Then, run it. We will see a the server login prompt in terminal:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223221337.png]]

## Step 2 - Access to Server (Lab) Via browser

In the VM machine, make sure that the lab's network service is refreshed by:

```bash
sudo system restart network.service
```

And see its IP address to access it via browser on host machine:

```bash
ip addr | grep eth0
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223221827.png]]

So, my lab IP address is `192.168.1.6`. On the host machine, I `ping` it to see the network is reachable:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223221945.png]]

If it doesn't succeeded, make sure the lab's VM network settings are set to **Bridge Adapter**.

Open a browser and enter `https://<server_ip>`:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223222203.png]]

If you see this, the server is reachable and you can proceed. Then, you will see Wazuh login page (username: **admin**, password: **admin**):

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223222405.png]]

After all, we'll see a SIEM dashboard after successful login. First of all, change `wazuh-alerts-*` to `wazuh-archive-*` because this is where we will be doing investigation scenarios:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223222739.png]]

To start investigating, head to _Menu > Discover_:
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223222956.png]]

After that, you must change your dashboard's date ranges to `Last 10 years` to make sure all the attack logs are visible for this lab (because this lab was created on `2024`):
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223223315.png]]

Finally, we can start our hands-on blue teaming operations!

# Web Investigation

## Exercise: 1.1 | SQL-Injection Activity detected

**Objectives**
The primary objective is to conduct a thorough investigation into a suspected SQl-injection Incident with the goal of identifying the source, scope, and impact of the attack.  
**Incident Details**  
Investigate the suspicious SQL-Injection activity detected by the security monitoring systems. Investigate the web logs to identify the targeted IP, source, and potential impact.

- **Targeted URL:** http://192.168.117.190/prod/vulnerabilities/sqli

**About SQLi**  
SQL injection is a type of web-based security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate or inject malicious SQL code into a query. This can happen when input from an application, such as a web form or URL parameter.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223224246.png]]

The first step of the investigation begins by analysing the web server logs. Open the SIEM Console and navigate to the **Discover** section:  
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223224456.png]]

> **Note**: Make sure that your are under wazuh–archives index

**Retrieving the web-accesslog**  
Identifying and collecting the web access log allows us to extract certain logs for additional
investigation. Use the following command to obtain the web-access log:

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog"
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223230210.png]]

**Examine the access logs**  
In general web server logs contain valuable information about incoming requests, errors, and server activities. It is recommended to check the access logs which record every request made to the server.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223231551.png]]

> **Note**: Access logs provide details like IP addresses, requested files, status codes, etc.

**Examine the URL**  
The next step is to observe the URL & URI request observed over the detected URL path, this helps us to identify the requests which are trying to be accessed by the attacker. Execute the below command and observe the findings.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log" and data.url: /prod/vulnerabilities/sqli*
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223231702.png]]

> As per the above result, we observed multiple SQL commands over the web url request. In general, it's not considered as a normal activity when we observe a SQL command over the URL/URI requests

**Examine the Status Codes**  
To validate or identify the suspicious activity it is recommended to check HTTP status codes of the observed logs. Execute the below query and observe the result.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log" and data.url: /prod/vulnerabilities/sqli* and data.url: *AND* or *UNION* or *SELECT* and data.id: *
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223232415.png]]

As per the observation we found a request with a status code 200.

> **Note**: HTTP 200 generally indicates a successful HTTP request. This particular request appears when a client sends a GET request to the server, and the server successfully retrieves the requested resource, it responds with a status code of `200`.

In case of SQL injection this specific pattern will be observed because the attacker will try executing multiple SQL commands over the web URL.

**Identify IP associated with the activity**  
After Identifying the attack pattern it's recommended to look for IP addresses associated with the enumeration activity. Execute the below command and observe the finding.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log" and data.url: /prod/vulnerabilities/sqli* and data.url: *AND* or *UNION* or *SELECT* and data.id: 200 and data.srcip: *
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223232700.png]]

In real case scenarios you might observe a lot more IP activity, it can be categories based on their legitimacy, behaviour and reputation.

**Conclusion**  
The thorough examination of the incident has allowed you to understand the sequence of events leading up to the occurrence, identifying areas for improvement in processes and procedures.

## Exercise: 1.2 | Cross Site Scripting Activity detected

**Objectives**  
The primary objective is to conduct a thorough investigation into a suspected Cross Site Scripting Incident with the goal of identifying the source, scope, and impact of the attack.  
**Incident Details**
Investigate the suspicious Cross Site Scripting activity detected by the security monitoring systems. Investigate the web logs to identify the targeted IP, source, and potential impact.

- Targeted URL: http://192.168.117.190/prod/vulnerabilities/xss_r/

**About XSS**  
XSS is a type of web-based security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate or inject malicious Java Script commands into a query. This can happen when input from an application, such as a web form or URL parameter.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223232941.png]]

**Examine the URL**  
This exercise is to observe the URL & URI request observed over the detected URL path, this helps us to identify the requests which are trying to be accessed by the attacker. Execute the below command and observe the findings.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log" and data.url : /prod/vulnerabilities/xss_r/*
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223233344.png]]

As per the above result, we observed multiple XSS commands over the web url request. In general, it's not considered as a normal activity when we observe a Java Script command over the URL/URI requests.

**Examine the Status Codes**  
To validate or identify the suspicious activity it is recommended to check HTTP status codes of the observed logs. Execute the below query and observe the result.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
and data.url : /prod/vulnerabilities/xss_r/* and data.id: *
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223233711.png]]

As per the observation we found multiple requests with a status code **200, 404, 302**. In case of XSS exploit this specific pattern will be observed because the attacker will try executing multiple Java Script commands over the web URL.

**Identify IP associated with the activity**  
After Identifying the attack pattern it's recommended to look for IP addresses associated with the enumeration activity. Execute the below command and observe the finding.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
and data.url : /prod/vulnerabilities/xss_r/* and data.id: "200" and
data.srcip : *
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223233935.png]]

## Exercise: 1.3 | Remote File Inclusion Activity detected

**Objectives**  
The primary objective is to conduct a thorough investigation into a suspected Remote File Inclusion Incident with the goal of identifying the source, scope, and impact of the attack.
**Incident Details**  
Investigate the suspicious RFI activity detected by the security monitoring systems. Investigate the web logs to identify the targeted IP, source, and potential impact.

- Targeted URL: http://192.168.117.190/prod/vulnerabilities/upload/

**About RFI**  
RFI is a type of web-based security vulnerability exploit that occurs when an attacker is able to upload suspected files including php, ps1, exe, ddl etc directly into the web server. This can happen when the upload function of a web application has not been properly sanitised, by exploiting such a vulnerability the attacker can directly deploy the payload and gain a stable shell with the targeted web server.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223234219.png]]

**Examine the URL**  
The next step is to observe the activity which is associated with the detected URL, Execute the below command and observe the findings.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log" and data.url : /prod/vulnerabilities/upload/
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223234608.png]]

**Investigate the POST request**  
Generally, an HTTP POST request is used during the file upload process on a web application.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
and data.url : /prod/vulnerabilities/upload/* and data.protocol : "POST"
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223234750.png]]

**Co-relate with PCAP**  
In-general POST request doesn’t provide a high visibility, in such it is recommend to correlate with network traffic, in our scenarios we have attached the PCAP file of the specific activity named: **suspected.pcapng**

> **Wireshark** is a popular and powerful open-source network protocol analyzer. It allows you to capture and inspect the data travelling back and forth on a network in real-time or from a previously recorded file. Wireshark supports a wide range of protocols and provides detailed information about the packets exchanged between devices on a network.

Execute the below mentioned command over the wireshark to specifically filterout detected src IP activity:

```
ip.addr == 192.168.132.143
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223234930.png]]

For the above result we identified that the src has been try access the url `/prod/hackable/uploads/rev.php`

**Investigate the detected file activity**  
The next step is to attempt to get the detected information via the SIEM console after identifying the file, which is advised to be redirected to. Execute the below mentioned command and observe the result.

```
decoder.name: "web-accesslog" and location : "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
and data.protocol : "GET" and data.url : "/prod/hackable/uploads/rev.php"
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223235036.png]]

**Identify the root cause**  
After gathering every possible information it's time to determine the root cause for the detected activity, typical RFI will maintain a stable shell with the attacker machine. To determine the particular activity again redirect to the PCAP file and execute the following command:

```
ip.src == 192.168.117.190
```

We have simply keep the detected src as a destination to observe every incoming request.

In-real case scenarios the network traffic might be too hard to be prioritised due to its large network connectivity, in such cases it's recommended to check based on the suspected port based access. As per the observation over the PCAP we observed that the src is been trying to communicating to an suspected IP over the port **9001**:

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223235202.png]]

Execute the below mentioned command to specifically filter out the suspected port activity:

```
ip.dst == 192.168.117.190 && tcp.srcport == 9001
```

On further deep investigating the packet we identified multiple host command over the targeted web-server.

# Network Investigation

## Exercise: 1.4 | External Network Communication Detected

**Objectives**  
The primary objective is to conduct a thorough investigation into a suspected external network communication Incident with the goal of identifying the source, scope, and impact of the attack.  
**Incident Details**  
Investigate the suspicious external communication activity detected by the network monitoring systems. Investigate the PCAP to identify the targeted IP, source, and potential impact.  
**Resources:**

- **PCAP File Name**: `externalpcapng`
- **Target Port**: `4444`

**About RFI**  
External network communication refers to the interaction and data exchange between a local network and external networks, when a attacker successfully deploy the payload over the host machine it will establish a stable connection between the attacker and the victim.  
 ![[Notebook/Notes/attachments/Pasted image 20260222131649.png]]

The first step of the investigation begins by analysing the given network PCAP. We have provided you with the suspected PCAP file which has been extracted from one of the compromised host machines.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260222132025.png]]

> **Wireshark** is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer that allows users to capture and inspect the data travelling back and forth on a network in real time.

Investigating external communication involves careful steps to ensure security and determine the nature and potential threats associated with the network logs.

1. Prioritise the detected port activity
2. Identifies source and destination IP addresses
3. Examine the traffic flow
4. Examine the External to Internal traffic

**Prioritise the detected port activity**  
Identifying and extracting particular logs which are associated with the identified activity. Use the following command to obtain the web-access log.

```wireshark
tcp.dstport == 4444
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260222132231.png]]

> **Decoders** are the key components which are responsible for parsing raw logs into a structured format that can be easily analysed and understood by the system.

**Identifies source and destination IP addresses**  
The next step is to identify and retrieve the IP activity which are associated with the detected port activity, from the above result we identified that the `src 192.168.132.238 → 192.168.132.242` over destination port `4444`.

```wireshark
tcp.dstport == 4444 && ip.src == 192.168.132.238 && ip.dst == 192.168.132.242
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260222132532.png]]

**Examine the traffic flow**  
To examine the network traffic it is recommended to check the packet flag from the above observation result. We identified **SYN** **ACK** this pattern observed when a src dest established a stable communication, and **PSH** command generally observed when a src trying to transmit data or executing command.  
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260222133142.png]]

This particular pattern was observed when a victim got compromised and established a stable shell with the attacker machine. On further checking the packet we identified multiple OS command associated with the network activity.
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260222135814.png]]
![[attachments/Pasted image 20260222135842.png]]

**Examine the External to Internal traffic**  
After determining the suspicious attack pattern its recommend to check the reverse traffic vice verse, by examin the vice verse traffic its give a better visibility over the detected activities.

```wireshark
ip.src == 192.168.132.242 && ip.dst == 192.168.132.238
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260222140948.png]]

As per the above result we identified a stable communication with multiple PUSH requests,
examining the PUSH request to identify the command execution.

### Conclusion

- Port `4444` is been associated with suspicious network communication on Remote File Inclusion Activity detected.
- Src port `49816` is associated with dst port `4444` in given `external.pcapng`.

# Forensics Investigation

## Exercise: 1.5 | Memory Dump Analysis

**Objectives**  
The primary objective is to conduct a thorough investigation into a suspected memory dump with the goal of identifying the source, scope, and impact of the attack.
**Incident Details**  
Investigate the suspicious endpoint compromise activity by the Endpoint monitoring systems. Investigate the .RAW file to identify the targeted IP, source, and the root cause of the activity.

- **Memory Dump**: `suspected.raw`

**About Memory Dump Analysis**  
Memory dump analysis plays a critical aspect of identifying the root cause and incident response, A memory dump, also known as a core dump or a crash dump, is a file that captures the contents of a computer's volatile memory at a specific point in time. This snapshot of memory can provide valuable information for understanding system behaviour, identifying anomalies, and investigating security incidents.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223235547.png]]
The first step of the investigation begins by analysing the given memory dump. We have provided you with the suspected RAW file which has been extracted from one of the compromised host machines.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260223235847.png]]

For our investigation we will be processed using the volatility3-2.4.1, feel free to download from the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3/archive/refs/tags/v2.4.1.zip
```

**Gather the information**  
The first step of investigation begins by analysing the basic information such as the operating system version, architecture, and system configuration can aid in accurately identifying the system being analysed.

Use the following command to obtain the basic information for the detected image dump.

```bash
sudo python3 vol.py -f <file_path> windows.info.Info
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260224000925.png]]

**Examine the running process**  
After gathering the basic information the next step is to investigate and begin by analysing the behaviour of running processes, this particular approach will help in understanding normal and abnormal activities on the detected compromised system.

```
sudo python3 vol.py -f <file_path> windows.pslist.PsList
```

Searching for the suspected process in a memory dump is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. It generally requires a high level of skill-set of understanding, it's recommended to go through each and every running process and filter-out the suspicious process.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260224001406.png]]

As per the above result the file shell.exe seems to be a suspicious process running.

**Determine the command line activity**  
After determine the suspicious process its recommend to cross verify the process with the
command line activity execute the below mentioned commands and observe the findings

```bash
sudo python3 vol.py -f <File_Path>/suspected.raw windows.cmdline.CmdLine
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260224001648.png]]

As per the above result we did not observe any suspicious command execution associated with the executables.

> Generally many malicious exe are been associated with multiple command execution activity, it's been recommended to cross-verify the activity which are associated with the detected `.exe`

**Download the detected DUMP file**  
Next step of the investigation is to download the detected suspicious file for further investigation to, using our raw image file we can easily retrieve the file using the PID value associate with it, execute the below mentioned commands and observed the result:

```bash
sudo python3 vol.py -f <file_path>/suspected.raw windows.pslist --pid 7396 --dump
```

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260224001849.png]]

After extracting the dump the next step is to check for the strings associated with the dump file.

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260224001921.png]]

In majority of the cases we might find interesting value but we did not observed any interesting value in our case it recommended to analyse the dump via **VirusTotal**, upload the extracted dump directly into the VirusTotal for further analysis: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/

![[attachments/Pasted image 20260224002035.png]]

As per the result from the VT, we confirm that the detected file is malicious.

**Examine the network traffic**  
After determining it suspiciousness its recommend to determine whether is there any network activity associated with the detected file, to list all network connection execute the below mentioned command and observed the result:

```bash
sudo python3 vol.py -f <file_path>/suspected.raw windows.netstat.NetStat
```

When we got the result, we clearly observed that the detected executable **shell.exe** has been successfully communicating to an IP `192.168.121.242` via port `4444`
